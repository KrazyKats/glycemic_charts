          Lots of new sensor data from wearable devices allows us detailed access to information 
          about blood glucose levels ‚Äî the sugar in your blood. By leveraging data collected through these sensors,
          we can uncover more insights into your health. 
        </p>
        <p>
          This project uses data from a <a href="https://physionet.org/content/big-ideas-glycemic-wearable/1.1.2/">study</a>
          that tracked glucose and other physiological markers in 12 participants over 10 days. 
          While the study aimed to assess the feasibility of wearable devices in
          detecting early signs of physiological changes related to prediabetes and hyperglycemia,
          our project zooms in on a specific aspect of the data. In particular, we focus on the impact of
          <strong>proteins</strong> and <strong>carbohydrates</strong> on blood sugar levels.
        </p>

        <strong>What is Blood Sugar and Why Is It Important?</strong>
        <p>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar_level">Blood sugar</a> is a measure of 
          the concentration of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose">glucose</a> in your blood. 
          Keeping it steady is essential,and your body produces hormones like insulin to help regulate it. 
          However, glucose levels can fluctuate quite a bit ‚Äî especially after meals. 
          If glucose levels frequently spike sharply, then your body can get overwhelmed.
          These blood glucose spikes can lead to a range of issues, including:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Fatigue:</strong> A couple hours after having a spike, blood
            sugar levels can drop sharply, resulting in feelings of fatigue and
            even irritability.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Vascular damage:</strong> Frequent blood sugar spikes can
            damage the linings of blood vessels, which can lead to nerve, kidney,
            and heart problems.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          In contrast, keeping your blood sugar stable provides a more consistent
          flow of energy, helping you avoid crashes and feel more balanced
          throughout the day. That's why understanding what causes these changes
          is crucial.

      <!-- Blood Sugar Spike Explanation -->
      <div class="description" id="intro-text">
        <strong>What is a Blood Sugar <i>Spike</i>?</strong>
        <p>
          Speaking of sugar spikes, it's important we define what a ‚Äúblood glucose spike‚Äù even is. 
          For our purposes, we define a blood glucose spike as the sharp increase in blood sugar
          that occurs after a meal. Specifically, we calculate it like this:
        </p>
        <p>
          \[
          \text{Spike} = \text{Max Glucose (2 hours after meal)} - \text{Average Glucose (before meal)}
          \]
        </p>
        <p>
          That is, using the <strong>meal time as a reference point (time = 0)</strong>,
          we look at the <strong>highest blood glucose value</strong> in the 2 hours that follow,
          and subtract the <strong>average blood glucose</strong> from the 30 minutes that came before.
          The result tells us how much a person's blood sugar rose in response to eating.
        </p>
        <strong>Units</strong>
        <p>
          Also, you may have noticed that blood glucose levels are measured in mg/dL, which stands for milligrams per deciliter.
          Intuitively, this means we're measuring the amount of glucose (in milligrams) present in a small volume of blood
          (a deciliter is one-tenth of a liter). In simpler terms, mg/dL tells us how concentrated the sugar is in 
          your bloodstream.

          High Carb Meals Are Typically Followed With High Blood Sugar Spikes

              As the carbohydrate content of meals increases, we observe a steady and noticeable rise
              in the corresponding post-meal blood sugar spikes. 
            </p>
            <p>
              This supports the intuitive idea that meals higher in carbohydrates are consistently
              <i>linked</i> to higher blood sugar spikes. 
              There's a positive <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/correlation.html">correlation</a> 
              between carbohydrate content and average glucose spike values across the meals.

          High Protein Meals Have Less Pronounced Blood Sugar Spikes than High

              We observe an upward trend between protein content and glucose spikes, 
              though this trend is less pronounced than the one we saw with 
              carbohydrates. 
            </p>

            <p>
              However, we can't immediately conclude that protein is directly 
              orrelated with blood sugar spikes. In these meals, the protein content
              and carbohydrate content are <strong>positively correlated</strong> (r = 0.43), likely
              because calorie-dense meals tend to contain higher amounts of both protein
              and carbohydrates.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a result, the positive trend between protein levels and blood sugar spikes
              may be influenced by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding">confounding effect</a> 
              of carbohydrates.

              The highest blood sugar spike is only one metric to consider the
              different results of using different meal types. Another
              reasonable thing to consider is how much the blood sugar drops
              from its peak 2 hours after the meal. We can see that higher
              carbohydrate meals also have the blood sugar levels drop down most
              quickly. These rapid ups and downs are problematic.

          <p>
            First, we apply thresholds: meals with at least a moderate amount of protein
            (above the 34th percentile) are shown in green, while those with high carbs 
            (above the 75th percentile) are shown in red.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because protein and carbs are correlated, both meal types end up with similar average carb content ‚Äî 
            but very different levels of protein. This helps us control for carbs and 
            <strong>isolate how protein affects blood sugar</strong>.
          </p>

        </div>
        <div class="step">
          Next, we bring in time. Now you can see how glucose levels actually change over the two hours after a meal.
        </div>
        <div class="step">
          <p>
            The result? We re-affirm our previous conclusion that higher carbohydrates have higher blood sugar spikes. 
          </p>
          <p>
            And when protein levels are similar, both lines have a similar shape ‚Äî the "flatness" doesn't change much.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
          Now, we flip the script. This time, we control for carbs and 
          <strong>focus on how protein affects glucose response</strong>.
        </div>
        <div class="step">
          <p>
            Surprisingly, the high-protein (blue) line stays flatter and has a 
            <strong>lower peak</strong> compared to the low-protein (orange) one.
          </p>
          <p>
            So even though it looked like protein didn't matter earlier, once we control for carbs,
            we see that protein actually helps reduce blood sugar spikes. 
          </p>
          <p>
            This overturns the initial impression from the bar charts above.

            Overall, this supports the idea that more carbs lead to bigger spikes. But pairing carbs with protein can help flatten those changes.

            protein can slow down how fast your body digests carbs ‚Äî leading to a steadier release of energy instead of a quick spike.

        We find evidence for our intuitive conclusion that eating more
        carbohydrates at once will result in a larger post-meal carbohydrate
        spike. One way to make these blood sugar changes flatter is by eating
        high carbohydrate meals with protein. An article from the
        <a
          href="https://joslin.org/news-stories/all-news-stories/education/2021/07/carbs-protein-fats"

        provides us with an explanation for this: the high-protein can slow down
        the digestion of high-carbohydrate foods -- therefore allowing for the
        release of a steadier stream of energy.
