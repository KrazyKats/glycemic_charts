            <h2>1. What have you done so far?</h2>
            <p>
                We have begun making visualizations as AND plots where we explore glucose spikes based on macronutrient content.
                We have created the initial prototype of the webpage and the first few charts.
                We have also begun to look at using animations to show the the charts in increments such that as you scroll down more is revealed.
                We also have looked at tooltips and filtering to allow users to explore the data in more detail.

            <h2>2. What will be the most challenging of your project to design and why?</h2>
            <p>
                We think that the interactivity of the visualisations will be difficult to design.
                we want to create a plot that uses the stable glucose level after the meal and try to normalize the data to directly compare the levels of different agregate groups.
                We currently have a prototype that uses bar charts to do this but we want to convert to a line plot to show the time aspect as welland we can see if there can be quicker fall after a spike.
                Another way to add interactiveness is to allow users to filter the data by participant characteristics.
